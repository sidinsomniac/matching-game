# Matching Game

## A JavaScript Memory Matching Game

### How to play

* Clicking on 'Restart' will re-shuffle the game board and wipe out any previous game being played.
* There are a total of 8 pair of cards in the board. The player clicks on a card to reveal the symbol underneath.
* Player can only click one card at a time.
* If the symbol on the second card doesn't match that of the first, both cards will be hidden again.
* On the other hand, if both cards match, both cards stay open and turn blue.
* The game ends once all the cards have been matched to their corresponding pair.
* Click on 'Play Again' to restart the game.

### Score

* The number of moves the player makes is the deciding factor as to how many stars are awarded.
* The final scorecard would reveal how many stars have been awarded, how many moves it took, and the amount of time it took to finish the game.
